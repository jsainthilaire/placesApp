# Places - In Development

# Todo
- Change the way components/containers are being accessed, right now there is an issue with this webpack configuration + react + router v4 when trying to wrap the components in a container without a body(just to pass down data without creating a container react component).
- Add debounce function to the change events.
- Add missing components tests.
- Add a webpack configuration for production.
- Add server side rendering.
- Fix issue with the forebase depencies not being found while testing.
- Add Loading(isFeching, isSaving) flags to the store in order yo provide a better user experience.
- Add Review page and a review component.
- Add searcgh page to look up for all previously added places.
